### Demos - organization

The demos are organized in two or three levels.

First level identifies the target paper.

Second level is the testcase for that paper.

Third level is for uncertainty analysis (when the testcase generates multiple runs).

## 01-SALT-DESTRESSING/

The objective is to run a Thermo-viscoplastic simulation.

The salt caprock is stressed by reduced temperature and increased pressure in the reservoir.
The reservoir is poroelastic.

As the temperature diffuses in the caprock and the pressure increases in the reservoir,
we see deviatoric stress in the caprock.

The deviatoric is then dissipated by the viscoplastic behavior of the salt.

We want to understand whether the dissipation is enough to consider the salt in
hydrostatic stress conditions for operational decisions.
