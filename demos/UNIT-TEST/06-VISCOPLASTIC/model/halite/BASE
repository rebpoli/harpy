# This is simply a list of properties for the configuration identified in the name of the file
# Some properties are present in field units explicitly. Ex: PERMEABILITY_MD = Permeability in milidarcy

# The second word in the line identifies how things are to be read.
# Ex: POROSITY CON 0.2             => means a constant porosity of 20%. The word CON is optional
#     PERMEABILITY FILE_XYZ PERM-BASE  => looks for the file model/%mat_name%/PERM-BASE with a XYZ format
